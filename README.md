# IMP
CompVision Lab 1
Simple Image Processor. We were tasked with adding the following functions:

1)  Fix the reset function in the pulldown menu
2)  Rotate image 90 degrees, odd shaped images should work
3)  Show a histogram of the colors in a separate window
    Use the mapping function to normalize the distribution evenly

4)  Turn a color image into a grayscale and display it. 
5)  Turn a color image into a grayscale image and then do a 3x3 mask to do an edge detection
6)  Track a colored object.....orange is easiest. Results is a binary image that is black except where the colored object is located.
