CompVision Lab 1
Simple Image Processor. We were tasked with adding the following functions:

<li> Fix the reset function in the pulldown menu </li>
<li> Rotate image 90 degrees, odd shaped images should work </li>
<li> Show a histogram of the colors in a separate window</li>
    Use the mapping function to normalize the distribution evenly 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization
<li> Turn a color image into a grayscale and display it.</li>
<li> Turn a color image into a grayscale image and then do a 3x3 mask to do an edge detection.</li>
<li> Track a colored object.....orange is easiest. Results is a binary image that is black except where the colored object is located.</li>
